# LightSensor-TS4231
A versatile optical sensing module built around the TS4231 chip. It supports two primary use cases: acting as a receiver for Lighthouse (SteamVR) tracking systems, or functioning as a standalone high-speed photodiode sensor. Its low-latency response and modular design make it suitable for applications in motion tracking, light signal analysis, and embedded optical systems.
